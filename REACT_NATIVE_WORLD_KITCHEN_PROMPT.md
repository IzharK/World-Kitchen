# React Native World Kitchen Prompt

## Project Overview
This document outlines the prompt for creating a new React Native application similar to the existing Flutter project architecture titled "World Kitchen". The goal is to establish a clear set of guidelines and features that the React Native version should incorporate, ensuring consistency with the Flutter version while embracing the capabilities of React Native.

## Application Structure
- **Screens**: Define separate screens for each major functionality such as listing recipes, viewing recipe details, and user authentication.
- **Components**: Reusable components like buttons, form fields, and cards should mimic the design in the Flutter app.
- **Navigation**: Use React Navigation to implement a stack navigator for seamless transitions between screens.

## Features to Include
1. **Recipe Listings**:  Display a list of recipes with images, titles, and brief descriptions.
2. **Recipe Details**:  A detailed view that shows the full recipe, ingredients, and preparation steps.
3. **User Authentication**: Implement user sign-up and login functionalities using Firebase or a similar backend service.
4. **Favorites**: Allow users to mark recipes as favorites for easy access.
5. **Search Functionality**: Enable users to search for recipes by name or ingredient.

## Technology Stack
- **React Native**: For building the mobile application.
- **Redux or Context API**: For state management to ensure smooth data flow across components.
- **Axios or Fetch API**: For making API calls to the backend.
- **Firebase**: For user authentication and real-time database functionalities.

## Design
- Follow the material design principles used in the Flutter version.
- Ensure responsive design to cater to various screen sizes and orientations.

## Development Setup
- Provide instructions for setting up the development environment including dependencies and tools required.
- Include steps for running the application on both iOS and Android simulators or devices.

## Testing
- Outline strategies for writing unit and integration tests.
- Emphasize the importance of thorough testing to maintain app quality.

## Deployment
- Give guidance on deploying the application to App Store and Google Play.

## Conclusion
This prompt serves as the foundational document for the React Native World Kitchen project. It emphasizes the need to maintain a coherent structure and design language that emulates the current Flutter app while enhancing the user's experience through React Native's rich ecosystem.
